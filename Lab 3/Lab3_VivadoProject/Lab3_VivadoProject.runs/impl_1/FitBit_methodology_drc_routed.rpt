There is a large setup violation of -76.525 ns between generator/lastStart_reg_rep__1_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and generator/counter_reg[49]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#178 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -76.525 ns between generator/lastStart_reg_rep__1_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and generator/counter_reg[50]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#179 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -76.546 ns between generator/lastStart_reg_rep__1_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and generator/counter_reg[51]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
